# Zakarya's Neovim Config

I decided to get into Neovim because I thought it would be funny, here is the result.

## To install:

For Unix-like systems (Linux, MacOS, etc.):

(Remember to back up any existing configuration)
```bash
cd ~/.config/nvim

git clone https://git.colormatic.org/zakarya/nvim-config.git .
```

For Windows:  
Good luck.

For any other operating systems that I didn't mention:  
Have fun.

This configuration uses lazy.nvim for package management and Mason for collecting LSPs.

It also has formatting, autocomplete, and the Gruvbox theme.

**Special actions:**  
To activate the formatter, do `:Fmt`  
To open the file explorer window, do `:Exp`  
To enter the selected autocomplete selection, press `Tab`
To see information on the word at the cursor, press `Ctrl-K`. You can also hover over it with your cursor.
